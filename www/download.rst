Download and Installation
*************************

Not a developer?  There is also an online :doc:`KARL Demo <demo>` to evaluate the features and functionality of KARL.

As of the 3.0 release, KARL is relatively straightforward for both
developers and evaluators to download and install.  In particular,
there is **no installation for Windows**. See the :doc:`FAQ <faq>` for
an explanation and suggestion.

.. note::
    Note: The most up-to-date installation information is in the
    `developer installation page <https://github.com/karlproject/dev-buildout/blob/master/README.txt>`_
    that ships as the ``README.txt`` that comes in the software.
