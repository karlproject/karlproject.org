Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
********************************

Which license does KARL use?
============================

  KARL is licensed under the GPL.

Where does the name "KARL" come from?
=====================================

  Two sources. As an acronym, KARL stands for the "Knowledge And Resource
  Locator." Also, Karl Popper was a primary influence on George Soros, founder
  of the Open Society Institute. Mr. Popper originated the ideas of an open,
  civil society with transparency.

Can I get hosting or consulting for KARL?
=========================================

  Yes to both. :doc:`Contact Six Feet Up <contact>` for recommendations based on what you
  would like to do.

Why no Windows version?
=======================

  As of the 3.0 release, KARL is focused on the needs of organizations deploying
  KARL (OSI and others), plus the development team that makes and customizes
  KARL.

  Neither of these populations are Windows users. It is feasible for a competent
  Python developer to get KARL running under Windows, but is not part of the
  funded roadmap for the core development team.

  The most straightforward solution on Windows is to install a virtual machine
  environment for Windows, such as Sun's VirtualBox. Inside of this environment,
  install a Linux distribution such as Ubuntu. You gain the advantage of using a
  configuration that is common to other users and developers.
