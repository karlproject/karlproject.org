Welcome to the KARL project. KARL is an open source web system for
collaboration, organizational intranets, and knowledge management. Developed
by the  `Open Society Foundations <http://www.soros.org>`_ (OSF), it was
first introduced to the market in 2008, and is now used by many
international organizations, such as OXFAM GB, OSF, and more.

This KARL project website is designed to address the following needs:

* Give an **introduction** to the KARL application itself,
* **Demo** the features of KARL for organizations who are evaluating KARL for their knowledge management system, 
* Offer information on the **hosting services** for organizations who want an out of the box knowledge management system, 
* Provide **open source** developers access to KARL resources
