About the Open Society Foundations
==================================

The Open Society Foundations (OSF) work to build vibrant and tolerant democracies 
whose governments are accountable to their citizens. To achieve this mission, 
the Foundations seek to shape public policies that assure greater fairness 
in political, legal, and economic systems and safeguard fundamental rights. 
On a local level, the Open Society Foundations implement a range of initiatives 
to advance justice, education, public health, and independent media. At the same 
time, we build alliances across borders and continents on issues such as 
corruption and freedom of information. The Foundations place a high priority 
on protecting and improving the lives of people in marginalized communities.

Investor and philanthropist George Soros established the Open Society Foundations, 
starting in 1984, to help countries make the transition from communism. 
Our activities have grown to encompass the United States and more than 60 
countries in Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Each foundation 
relies on the expertise of boards composed of eminent citizens who 
determine individual agendas based on local priorities.


Collectively, the OSF encompass global programs addressing issues such as 
judicial reform and the rule of law, independent media, public health, 
gender equity, human rights and governance, information and internet 
innovations, economic and business development, and education from preschool 
to post-doctoral levels. National foundations and regional offices in over 
40 countries engage in similar issues on a more local level, resulting 
in a multidimensional intersection of international and local advocates, 
experts, managers, and infrastructure staff populating the OSF.  Further 
information about these entities and their work is available

Pre-KARL
========

As a highly decentralized network of cultural and civil society organizations,
the Open Society Foundations face many of the challenges of collaboration and
knowledge sharing as other distributed organizations. In September of 2005,
the OSF Board and Senior Management began a Knowledge Management Initiative
(KMI) to explore ways that the OSF network of organizations could work more
effectively across geographic and programmatic divides. The initiative started
with a small core group in the autumn of 2005 that explored both the
organizational and technical structure of OSF to look for improvements that
could be made. In early 2006, a working group of 25 staff members representing
various geographic and programmatic areas of our network was established. The
working group met by way of web conference on a monthly basis and used an
open-source collaboration tool known as Plone to share ideas and possible
solutions. This working group also received oversight and input from a group
of 10 senior managers within the network of organizations.

In June of 2006, the working group made a recommendation to OSF Senior
Management to invest in the development of a global intranet and on-line
collaboration system. The working group had researched the possibility of
finding a proprietary solution for OSFs' communication and collaboration
needs, but could not find an appropriate solution that could offer both the
functionality that OSF was looking for and the flexibility to be able to offer
tools to partner organizations and other individuals (grantees, consultants,
specialists, etc.) working closely with OSF without being subjected to
restrictive licensing fees and requiring users to install special software.
The working group had been quite pleased with the Plone collaboration tool
that was being used to manage the work of the group, so the further
recommendation was made to develop this new system using the open source Plone
software over the Zope application server.

KARL 1
======

OSF management approved the working group recommendation in July 2006 and
development of the new OSF system began the following month (August 2006). A
beta-version of the system was delivered in June 2007 and OSF officially
launched the KARL1 system in January of 2008. KARL is essentially a global
intranet for the OSF capable of offering a unique intranet homepage for each of the 40+
organizations within the network and offers the ability for individuals within the
network to self-organize within various communities of practice related to the
mission of the OSF.

KARL 2
======

As KARL attracted interest, the OSF took steps to move KARL1 off of the Windows
platform, in preparation for making an open source version. Additionally, work
was commissioned to make it possible (though not trivial) for other
organizations to customize KARL and use it for similar needs.

This work was commissioned in April 2008 and completed in the fall of that
year. It resulted in a version of KARL which, though not re-architected,
provided important infrastructure changes.

At that time OSF's KARL had about 3000 users with approximately half of the users being
OSF employees and the other half representing organizations outside of OSF. KARL2 also
had over 500 communities.

KARL 3
======

During the KARL2 work, it became clear that the goals for adoption of KARL and
ongoing enhancements required architectural re-thinking. Work was commissioned
on a version of KARL that used the technologies shared by Plone, but with a
narrower focus on the KARL application. Many of the problematic technologies
were replaced. This effort culminated in the release of KARL3 in spring of
2009. Currently, OSF's KARL has nearly 6,000 users and just under 1,000 communities.
