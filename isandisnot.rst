What KARL Is and Is Not
***********************

To correctly evaluate a product, it helps to get a concise, straightforward
statement about what is the product. Ideally, this answer also includes, what
the product does not claim to be.

KARL is:

* Simple set of well-integrated tools.
* A very lean user experience resulting from great attention to detail.
* Collaboration for project teams in a community.
* An intranet space with the "voice of the organization".
* Simple "knowledge management" facilities that connect the dots.
* Open source software that can be run by an organization or hosted by one
  of the KARL hosting providers.
* Fast, stable, reliable, tested.

KARL does not try to be:

* Aimed at power users. KARL views success as much by what is left out as
  by what is put in.
* A generic platform for a wide-range of application types. It is an
  end-user product, with a specific set of goals and user interface, that
  can be extended by developers.
* High-end social network site. There are some social networking aspects,
  but under the banner of KARL's major goals.
* A generic portal system to integrate and unify external applications.
* A classic content management system for internal workflows to publish
  content to external audiences.
* High-end intranet and document management system for managing desktop
  content.
* Sophisticated customer relationship management system.
