KARL 3 Architecture Guide
==============================

Developers and decision makers need to the technical architecture for
KARL3, particularly in relation to KARL2.  This document provides an
architecture guide, organized by feature functionality and technical
layer.

Guiding Point
=============

KARL is a product and not a framework.  This is a very deliberate,
important, and simplifying point that illustrates the gestalt of KARL
and its architecture.  While it is a customizable product, with a
pre-defined set of customization points, it isn't intended to be a
framework that allows usage in unexpected and pluggable fashion.
