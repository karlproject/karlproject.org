The KARL developers generally hang out in the following communications
channels:

- *IRC*.  On ``irc.freenode.net``, we're in the ``#karl`` channel.
   Some also hang out in the ``#repoze`` channel.

- *Issue Tracking*.  We use an issue tracker on Launchpad at
   ``https://bugs.launchpad.net/karl3``.

- We have a mailing list at
  ``http://lists.palladion.com/mailman/listinfo/osi-dev``.  In
  general, this is only for the core KARL developers.

For general development information, contact Paul Everitt by email
(paul at agendaless dot com).
