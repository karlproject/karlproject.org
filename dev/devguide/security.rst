Blog Entries and Comments
=========================

Unlike other community content, blog entries have slightly different
permissions that cover add/edit/delete as well as email-in.  Namely,
other community members/moderators cannot edit or delete blog entries
or comments.  Blog content is the "voice of the creator".

In the following, note that "member" also applies to "moderator".  A
moderator has no special permission regarding community content.

Blog Entry
----------

- *Addable* by member/admin

- *Viewable*

  - May be public or private, based on community state or based on
    assignment to a specific resource

  - Public blog entries by staff/member/admin

  - Private blog entries by member/admin

Blog Comment
------------

- *Addable* by anybody that can view the blog entry being commented on

- *Viewable* is inherited from the blog entry (the comment's
   container)

- *Editable* and *Deletable* by creator/admin
