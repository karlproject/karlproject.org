Seeing Changes Across KARL with Feeds
=====================================

In KARL, content is created in places such as communities and intranet
offices. How do I see a picture across all of KARL, letting me quickly
see what is new and changing?  The :term:`Feeds` feature provides ways
to productively stay up-to-date and find new content.

Nutshell
========

- Quickly look across all of KARL, peering across the "silos"

- Time-oriented, to quickly get up-to-date on what's happening

- Provides a "stumble-upon" way to discover new things

- Focused more on the changes in content, rather than the content

- Navigation focused on the people making the changes time-wise,
  rather than the resource being changed
