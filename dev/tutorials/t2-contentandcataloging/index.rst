======================
Content and Cataloging
======================

- like all of :mod:`repoze.bfg`, thin layers above existing machinery

- Opposite of a mega-framework.  Explain "do every possible general
  case, add hacks for special cases, you get Zope2.  Solve with
  pluggable integers, Zope3."  Pay for what you eat.

Objectives
==========

#. Basic content types using :mod:`repoze.lemonade`

#. Zope event handling with subscribers.

#. Full-text search with :mod:`repoze.catalog`



- Registering "actions"

  - add feed

  - edit and delete on feed
