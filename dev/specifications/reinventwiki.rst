=============
Reinvent Wiki
=============


- people don't actually want the zen of wiki

- they like referencemanual and structure

- certainly need to fix how assets (images, files, links) get into the
  authoring process (including search-based lookup)

- autonavigation is missing: wiki backlinks, table of contents, by
  author, by date, perhaps the ReferenceWiki auto-hierarchy and
  ordering

- Need some garding features (orphan cleanup, pages with few
  backlinks)

- Improved collaborative authoring: sorta-locking, useful history,
  perhaps annotations,

- Future of resurrect (should this be beyond wiki pages?)

- Should we allow bulk-attach in addition to insert-file (single),
  with the attachments auto-listed?  This might scratch the blog-entry
  abuse.
