WNG: Core UX and Widgets
========================

We could make attachment support a widget that users could choose to
insert into a page.  When should a feature be done as an always-there
part of the core UX vs. an optionally-there widget?

Take tagging for example.  Every piece of content has a tag box just
under the title, showing the current tags and allowing a new tag.
That could be replaced with a widget.  If the author of a piece of
content wanted tags on their page, they would include the Tag Widget
somewhere in their document.

That is likely to be viewed unfavorably.  The basics of tagging is a
central part of the system.  That support needs to always be there, in
the same spot, with the same behavior.

Attachments are less "optional" than tagging.  Making pages an
attractive alternative to file folders is the central part of the WNG
experience.  We need to ensure that it is always visible, as many of
the users won't know or won't use widgets.  Stated differently, most
won't even know attachment support exists.

We should, however, limit the core UX for attachments and allow
widgets that add extra power to the attached files.
