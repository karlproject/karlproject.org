============
WNG Prepwork
============

We plan to gradually implement the Wiki Next Generation (WNG) features
with incremental rollouts.  The first step will involve some prepwork
behind the scenes.

- Switch our homegrown buttons to jQuery UI buttons, for consistency
  across screens and browsers.

- Introduce a formal concept of a buttonbar "group".  We have an
  ad-hoc system now with a label on the left.  Switch to something
  that is consistent and doesn't require as much space.

- A good icon set for action buttons, along with a decent scheme for
  including them (sprites?).
