FreeKARL
========

The business plan needs a way to get a lot of users trying out KARL
for real work.  Then, when their needs advance to a certain level of
commitment, they have a different engagement with KARL.

This FreeKARL proposal provides this.  With FreeKARL, there is a KARL
site running where users can (with limits) make communities and invite
colleagues, without paying.

Proposal
========

- Run a KARL site as part of :doc:`multikarl` which is branded as a
  one-big-KARL, not under the name of any particular organization.

- Certain people can get accounts with KarlStaff access, allowing them
  to create communities and invite KarlAffiliate users.

- FreeKARL is for people and small teams, not organizational use.
  Once KARL becomes important enough to need an organizational
  commitment, they are upsold to a for-fee KARL.  Some ability to
  export information and/or share information from/between FreeKARL
  and a real KARL might be required (e.g. common profiles.)

- FreeKARL is also the venue for pan-KARL collaboration and
  information sharing (e.g. management of the KARL consortium, user
  manual authoring, etc.)  As such, it is reasonable to think, once
  upsold, users will remain active in FreeKARL.

- If possible, FreeKARL might also have plugins which allow certain
  information to be visible to anonymous visitors, thus being used as
  a normal internet site.

Specification
=============

- Allow some limits on resources to ensure that FreeKARL doesn't get
  out of hand.  For example, each KarlStaff can only create 5
  communities, each community can only hold X documents.

- Upsell from FreeKARL to small/medium/large might require an
  export/import step to bring along any FreeKARL content which needs
  to fly under the new flag.

- Use FreeKARL as the place to stash information that is pan-KARL
  (e.g. user manual) or perhaps even anonymous-accessible (marketing
  info.)

- Changes in security model.

- No /offices intranets.

- Impact of identity and profiles.

- Don't leave their FreeKARL behind.

- Flexible restrictions on who is given access.

- Impact on PEOPLE and TAGS tabs.  Anybody who is KarlStaff will be
  able to see anybody.  Does that make sense?

- How do organizations choose a pile of users in FreeKARL when doing
  the upsell?
