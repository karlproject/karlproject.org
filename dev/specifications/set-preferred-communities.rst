Set Preferred Communities
=========================

Allow users to curate the list of communities visible in the "My
Communities" portlet.  Closely related to the *My Communities without
Preferred* specification.

.. note::

  Most of the writeup for this is in the
  :ref:`communities-portlet-curating-label` section of the related
  specification.

Product Backlog Description
===========================

As a user with a large number of communities, I can opt to show only
my “preferred” communities by default in the My Communities box rather
than an A-Z listing of all My Communities.  By clicking the “show all”
link, I can switch to the A-Z listing of My Communities.  * NOTE: The
method of setting your preferred communities is an implementation
detail.

Implementation
==============

See :ref:`communities-portlet-curating-label` in the related
specification.
