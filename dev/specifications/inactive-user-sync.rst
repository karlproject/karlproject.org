==================
Inactive User Sync
==================

Allow GSA to make a staff or former staff "inactive".

Product Backlog Description
===========================

As an external system integrating user management with KARL
(i.e. GSA), I can send either a 0 or 1 for the attribute "Active" to
set the user as active or inactive during sync.

Specification
=============

#. From the GSA sync perspective, this is not related to the process
   of making someone former staff.  In theory, someone that still has
   KarlStaff as a group could be made inactive, then active again,
   then inactive.
