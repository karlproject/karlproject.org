WNG-5: Email-in wiki pages and attachments
==========================================

Summary: Mail-enable the wiki tool to allow creation of wikipages with
file attachments via email.

The blog tool's email-in facility is a great enabler for many people
using KARL.  Some though are mis-using this facility to maintain
document archives and manually linking to the wiki.  Since blog
entries are only editable by their creator, they are the "voice of the
author".  Finally, blogs are "temporal" in concept and meant to flow
into the past.

Allowing pages to be created via email brings the dramatic ease-of-use
of email-in to group documents, instead of just blogs.

Furthermore, converting emails with attachments to pages with
attachments makes for an ideal document repository.
