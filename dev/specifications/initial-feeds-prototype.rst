=======================
Initial Feeds Prototype
=======================

Basic idea: KARL changes (hopefully) constantly.  What's changed since
the last time I looked?

Notes
=====

#. ACLs are inherited based on time of creation:

   - what about ACL inheritance on a wiki page in a community, if they
     are later removed from the community?  it would be really cool if
     those in-the-past FeedItems disappeared from their feed because
     they were no longer in the community (and lost the inherited
     permission)

- categorizing FeedItem so we can filter by kinds of actions (add
  vs. edit)

- prime the pump with a bunch of feed entries

- edit/delete by admin

- do we only keep 90 days of feed-pile?

- FeedItems are not *currently* taggable
