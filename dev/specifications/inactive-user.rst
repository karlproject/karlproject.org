=============
Inactive User
=============

Instead of deleting users, we inactivate them.

Product Backlog Description
===========================

As a non-staff user, I can make my profile inactive in KARL.  Doing so
will prevent future login for my user profile, prevent me from
receiving email alerts, prevent me from sending email into KARL, and
prevent my profile from showing anywhere in the system (including
search, people directory, and community membership listing) with the
exception of when viewing content I have authored in which case the
link to my profile still works for historical reference.
Administrators can also perform this same functionality on any
non-staff user.

Specification
=============

The backlog description has sufficient detail.
